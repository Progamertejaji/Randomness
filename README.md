# Randomness

## What does it do?
Well, what do you want it to do? Well, rather, what does everyone want it to do.

## How does it work?
The program you downloaded has 1 thing to do, and it's to download this file, and run it's code: https://github.com/thepwrtank18/Randomness/blob/master/code.cs

## Who can edit it?
Anyone with a GitHub Account?

## What are the rules?
Don't make anything that will suspend my GitHub account (e.g. malware). Also note that *you* are responsible for anything it runs.
