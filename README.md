# Randomness

## What does it do?
Well, what do you want it to do? Well, rather, what everyone wants it to do.

## How does it work?
The program you downloaded has 1 thing to do, and it's to download this file, and run it's code: https://github.com/thepwrtank18/Randomness/blob/master/code.cs

## Who can edit it?
Anyone with a GitHub Account.

## What are the rules?
Don't make anything that will suspend my GitHub account (e.g. malware). Also note that *you* are responsible for anything it runs.

## Credits
I would like to thank [Hassan Habib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDS3wehEZxA) for making a video on how Hot Reload works, which inspired me to make this idea.
